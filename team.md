Our Chairman Dr Jithedhranath is well known award winning telemedicine practitioner who founded C4S with likeminded people to deliver compassionate service through independent platforms. He has been working among the tribal communities for 30 years who are living in remote villages without access to healthcare, education and sustainable livelihood. C4S is receiving technological help from all over the world to develop meaningful practices to improve the quality of service to the community. Our beloved chairman leads us to the new world of connectivity in human and machine terms.

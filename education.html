            <h3>Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam about our project</h3>
            <p>
            "Arividam means a place for knowledge and information. Knowledge makes an individual great; hence the objective ofÂ the Arividam project is to evolve great citizens for the state of Kerala. The focus of Arividam project is the delivery of educational information and knowledge to students, teachers and the public in order to bridge the digital gap at the regional level. It includes video collaboration, people's networking coupled with innovative planning and execution which can be a wonderful tool in taking knowledge to the masses."

            <h1>Major Works</h1>
            <p><strong>Project Arividam</strong> was conceived as an online collaboration space for students and teachers from 150 schools in the Wayanad region. The portal allowed students to upload content related to their courses and schools. Apps such as a student wiki to collect local folklore and indigenous knowledge were built in Malayalam for the first time and gradually, the portal has gained recognition in the education space in Kerala. The project has been realised with the support of the Department of General Education, Government of Kerala </p>
            <p><strong>Project Sampoorna</strong> is the most successful state-wide education, information and school management system in India supported by C4S for the Department of General Education, Government of Kerala. The academic and management processes from class teacher to State Director of Public Instruction (DPI) have been automated through this platform. Lakhs of students in 15,000 schools who are admitted each year are managed through Sampoorna.</p>
            <p><strong>PEECS LMS.</strong> C4S has developed an entrance tutorial platform for school students where entrants can sign upto their page online and get coached for med/engg entrance exams. The method, framework and platform of this e-ntrance coaching system have been adapted for the prestigious public entrance exam-coaching scheme-www.peecs.kerala.gov.in- coaching scheme of govt of Kerala. Designed as a self-coaching system for entrance aspirants, the platform has unique potential to become the best online coaching platform to get in to the preferred courses and colleges</p>

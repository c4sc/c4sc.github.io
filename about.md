Centre for Social Computing & Information Society (known as C4S) is an ‘ICT4D’ society registered under Societies Registration Act in 2013. C4S takes a broad inter-disciplinary approach to enable change and social development using Information and Communication Technology. We are developing our practices within communities and redefining ‘IT’ as inclusive transition for digital equality. Taking solutions beyond the market driven  playground of start ups and apps, C4S has its own communication networks, tools, platforms and open source philosophy    to be delivered to the digital have nots in the city and village which will enable them to reclaim the ownership and autonomy of digital resources.

Our simple mission is to bring new technologies and solutions to digitally underserved communities,   allowing them to create their own knowledge economies and enabling them to connect on their own terms with the world at large.

C4S was founded in Wayanad Kerala the southern state of India by a group of community technologists from diverse backgrounds and now expanding across communities. The organisation has TRUSTed approach –Technologies for Rural & Urban Social Transformation - to build alternative infrastructure for education, healthcare and environment.  We are working with agencies of knowledge, local, state and central governments in different areas to enable grassroot development.

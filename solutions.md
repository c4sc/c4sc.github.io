# Video Consultation

Enterprise video conference solutions in the market are expensive and not yet programmed as a stable solution. We have developed an open sourced,   Rasberry Pi based simple video communication module attachable to LED tv which has been implemented in Wayanad scenario in a cost effective manner. Doctors and patients are using this solution in a regular basis for tele consultation. The solution is working reliably in Wayanad   teleclinics using the high bandwidth of WLAN network. It can be deployed online for wider delivery of service. The system will work without a computer, internet and cellular network. Only a LED tv is required as a hardware to run the video conference system.


# Community Telephony

Smart phone based free telephony between connected has been enabled in the clinics and tribal settlement. Tribal people from the settlement can make phone calls to the hospital without waiting for the stable mobile signal and internet. The facility has been found very useful for the community to keep connected with the external world especially for the settlements inside forest area.

# Mobile Radio 

As a health and educational program for the community, implementation of mobile based streaming radio is underway in the settlements which will literate the community in relevant areas. And the student community in the settlement can be benefitted from these platforms and exposure to learn more about technology.
